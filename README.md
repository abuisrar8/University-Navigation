Simple Navigation System For LPU

Introduction:-

This project will help you to navigate from some blocks of LPU (i.e.block 25,block 26,block 27,block 28,vlock 29,block 30 etc) this project is totally based on Dijkstras shortest path algorithm.

By the help of Tkinter and some other important resources we have made map from scratch.

It will take two entries, current and final destinations, by clicking on the enter button on the map, a possible shortest path will display.
